Met spec on first submission.

Select quotes from the review: 

"I had a lot of joy reviewing your work :) Hope to review some of your future works"

"Really excited when reading your code, I quite enjoyed how you tested various parameters on the images, the reduced region of interest, and also the "Hough Lines" test!"

"Not many students are able to ensure that the hough lines for the videos "white.mp4" or "yellow.mp4", but you have, which is quite intriguing :)"

"Overall, a really good solution..."

"...you have passed it with flying colours..."
